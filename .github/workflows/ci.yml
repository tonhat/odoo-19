# Plan (pseudocode)
# 1) Open the GitHub Actions workflow that defines the "test" job (likely .github/workflows/ci.yml or tests.yml).
# 2) Find the matrix that includes Python "3.1" (or "3.1.x") and remove it (it's EOL and not available on ubuntu-24.04 via setup-python).
# 3) Keep only supported versions (e.g., 3.10–3.13) or whatever your project supports.
# 4) Set matrix.fail-fast = false so one failing entry doesn't cancel the rest.
# 5) Ensure actions/setup-python uses `python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}`.
