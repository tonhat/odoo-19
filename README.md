Odoo is a suite of web based open source business apps.

The main Odoo Apps include an [Open Source CRM](https://www.odoo.com/page/crm),

[eCommerce](https://www.odoo.com/app/ecommerce),
[Warehouse Management](https://www.odoo.com/app/inventory),
[Project Management](https://www.odoo.com/app/project),
[Billing &amp; Accounting](https://www.odoo.com/app/accounting),
[Point of Sale](https://www.odoo.com/app/point-of-sale-shop),
[Human Resources](https://www.odoo.com/app/employees),
[Marketing](https://www.odoo.com/app/social-marketing),
[Manufacturing](https://www.odoo.com/app/manufacturing),

Odoo Apps can be used as stand-alone applications, but they also integrate seamlessly so you get
a full-featured [Open Source ERP](https://www.odoo.com) when you install several Apps.

## Getting started with Odoo

For a standard installation please follow the [Setup instructions](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/administration/install/install.html)
from the documentation.

To learn the software, we recommend the [Odoo eLearning](https://www.odoo.com/slides),
or [Scale-up, the business game](https://www.odoo.com/page/scale-up-business-game).
Developers can start with [the developer tutorials](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/developer/howtos.html).

## Security

If you believe you have found a security issue, check our [Responsible Disclosure page](https://www.odoo.com/security-report)
for details and get in touch with us via email.

## CI/CD

- **CI**: A GitHub Actions workflow is added at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It runs on `push` and `pull_request` for `main`, sets up Python 3.10–3.13, installs dependencies, performs quick import/compile checks and runs tests if present.
- **Pages**: The static site in the `docs/` directory is deployed to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/pages.yml` on pushes to `main`. Enable Pages in your repository settings if needed.

To enable Pages deployment, ensure the repository `main` branch is allowed to deploy and that the `docs/` folder contains your site content (there is an existing `docs/index.html`).

If you need me to push these workflow files to GitHub (or help fix SSH credentials), say so and I will run the commit + push.
